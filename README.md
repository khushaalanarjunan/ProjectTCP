##Program Flow

##Program Execution

Step 1: Run the Server Application using the `mvn exec:java` command.

Step 2: Open a new terminal and run a new Client Application using the `mvn javafx:run` command.

Step 3: Repeat the same process as in Step 2. We need at least 2 Clients to demonstrate how our app works.

Step 4: Now, please fill in your name and enter the group chat. Do the same for both Clients.

Step 5: Now, Client 1 can start sending some messages to the server, and it will be displayed to all the clients that are connected to the server. On the sender’s side, the message will be on the right side with a green bubble, and on the receiver’s side, the message will be on the left-hand side with a gray bubble.

Step 6: Now, let’s try sending an image.

Step 7: Click the Logout button, and it will redirect you to the login page. You can either log in with your previous name or use some other new names. If you use your exact previous name, all your previous messages will be presented to you on your right side. Otherwise, you will be considered a new user, and all the messages will be on the left-hand side.


Note: We have also included a beep sound for every notification that the client receives. The notification sound will ring for all clients except the sender.
